Both IC review applications raise a similar issue as to whether a practical refusal reason exists under s 24AA(1) of the FOI Act for refusing the applicants requests for access to diary entries of the current and a former Prime Minister. The two decisions under review are:  a decision of the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet (the Department) of 11 February 2011, refusing access to three months of diary entries of former Prime Minister, the Honourable Kevin Rudd MP; and a decision of the Office of the Prime Minister of 25 March 2011, refusing access to one month of diary entries of the current Prime Minister, the Honourable Julia Gillard MP. I affirm both decisions to refuse access to documents under s 24(1) of the FOI Act. I am satisfied that a practical refusal reason exists in each case. Specifically, I am satisfied that the work involved in processing each request would, in relation to the diary entries of former Prime Minister Rudd, substantially and unreasonably divert the resources of the Department from its other operations; and in relation to the diary entries of Prime Minister Gillard, substantially and unreasonably interfere with the Prime Ministers functions."

The result of this decision is that the Department is required by s 55N of the FOI Act to provide to the FOI applicant (Mr Hedley Thomas) certain documents that are described below. However, the Department cannot take that step until the opportunities available to the person who initiated this IC review (referred to as AK) to apply to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal for review of this IC review decision have run out (FOI Act, ss 4(1), 27A(6)). In order to preserve the effectiveness of that right of review, these reasons do not contain information that directly identifies AK or that reveal the substance of the documents that are in contention. I am, however, aware that the identity of AK is known to the FOI applicant and formed the basis of the request that he made to the Department under s 15 of the FOI Act for access to documents.  "

These reasons for decision also discuss more generally   whether an incoming government brief prepared for a party that did not form government may, in its entirety, be a conditionally exempt document under s 47E of the FOI Act, and whether an incoming government brief prepared for a party that did form government may, as to the deliberative matter in the document, be a conditionally exempt document under s 47C of the FOI Act. No concluded view is expressed on either issue. Neither issue squarely arises for decision in this case. Both ss 47C and 47E are also public interest conditional exemptions, which means that the exempt status of a document can be determined authoritatively only at the time a decision is to be made. A conditionally exempt document must be released unless disclosure, at the time of decision, would on balance be contrary to the public interest (FOI Act s 11A(5)). These reasons discuss public interest factors that may be considered when such an issue arises for decision. "

The main points in this decision concerning s 47F of the FOI Act (the personal privacy exemption) are: The term personal information should bear the same meaning in the FOI Act and the Privacy Act 1988 (Privacy Act). Accordingly, in applying s 47F of the FOI Act, regard should be had to the comprehensive privacy protection framework in the Privacy Act and the Information Privacy Principles (IPPs) (to be replaced from 12 March 2014 by the Australian Privacy Principles). The term personal information can apply to any information that reasonably identifies a public official, including vocational assessment and routine work information.  The view adopted in many earlier cases, and relied upon by the agency in this case, that it would not be unreasonable to release vocational assessment information relating to a successful candidate for promotion should be reassessed in light of changes in privacy law, information technology and community concern about privacy protection. Those changes are also relevant to whether it would be contrary to the public interest to release vocational assessment information relating to a successful candidate. The release of vocational assessment information under the FOI Act is different to providing participants in a competitive personnel selection process with information about other candidates, including the successful candidate. The FOI Act does not require that access principles under both regimes are consistent. If guidelines are issued by the Australian Public Service Commissioner (APSC) under regulation 9.2(6) of the Public Service Regulations 1999 (PS Regulations), concerning the use and disclosure of personal information, agency compliance with the guidelines will be a relevant consideration in deciding (under s 47F of the FOI Act) whether disclosure of personal information relating to a public official would be unreasonable and contrary to the public interest."

That matter is conditionally exempt under s 47C. This includes factual material that is an integral part of the deliberative content and that is impractical to excise. It would be contrary to the public interest under s 11A(5) to release that deliberative matter, having regard in particular to the special purpose of an IGB to provide frank and helpful advice to a new Minister at a critical juncture in the system of responsible parliamentary government. Some of the material in the IGB, relating to the role, functions, personnel and resources of the Department, is neither deliberative matter nor related to a deliberative process. It is not conditionally exempt under s 47C.  Section 47E(d), which provides conditional exemption for disclosure that would have a substantial adverse effect on the operations of an agency, does not provide any exemption coverage in this case greater than that provided by s 47C. Section 47E(d) does not provide exemption for the material in the IGB relating to the role, functions, personnel and resources of the Department. It is doubtful that brief comments in the IGB on legal issues arising in significant litigation involving the Commonwealth is exempt under s 42 (legal professional privilege). Although some deliberative content in the IGB could separately be released without consequence, it is not reasonably practicable in this IC review process to prepare an edited copy of such a lengthy document that covers an extensive range of topics (s 22). This decision is given on the same day as another decision that deals with similar issues, Crowe and Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet  [2014] AICmr 72. Two special issues discussed in that decision are that the IGB was prepared for the Prime Minister, and had been prepared nearly four years previously."
 David Crowe ,Prime Minister and Cabinet, ,30 July 2014, MR11/00014 ,http://www5.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/AICmr/2014/72.html,affirm,FOI," I affirm the decision of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet (the Department) of 19 January 2011 (as revised) to refuse access to documents requested under the Freedom of Information Act 1982 (the FOI Act). This decision is given on the same day as another decision that deals with similar issues arising from an FOI request for access to an Incoming Government Brief (IGB) prepared for a party that formed government, Parnell & Dreyfus and Attorney-Generals Department  [2014] AICmr 71. The issues are discussed more fully in that decision (though it arose later in time than this case) because it relates more broadly to a decision refusing access to the entirety of an IGB. Another relevant IC review decision is Crowe and Department of the Treasury [2013] AICmr 69, which concerned the exemption status of portions of an IGB prepared for a party that did not form government. Two special issues discussed in the present decision are that the IGB was prepared for the Prime Minister, and was prepared nearly four years prior to this decision. Generally, this decision affirms the reasoning in Parnell & Dreyfus and in Crowe, that for FOI Act purposes it is in the public interest to maintain the practice whereby confidential deliberative advice on the full range of portfolio issues can be prepared for and provided to a Minister following a national election, in the form of an IGB."

The exemption contention rested principally on s 47E (certain operations of agencies exemption). The decision affirms the exemption of a document that discussed a draft of the report. "

The main points in this decision concerning s 47F (the personal privacy exemption) are: In deciding whether disclosure of personal information in a document would be unreasonable under s 47F, an agency may take into account any submission  an FOI applicant chooses to make in support of their application as to their reasons for seeking access and their intended or likely use and dissemination of the information. An agency may also take into account that the FOI Act does not limit or restrain the further dissemination of that information by the applicant. However, it is incorrect to proceed from the premise that disclosure under the FOI Act is tantamount to disclosure to the world at large, or that a document released to an FOI applicant will be available to any person who makes a request for that information in accordance with FOI Act procedures. Those considerations are similarly relevant to other FOI Act exemption provisions that require an agency to consider whether disclosure would be contrary to the public interest. It would generally be unreasonable and contrary to the public interest to disclose personal identifying information of a person who has accessed a government service that is made freely available to members of the public on the basis and in the expectation that a persons use of the service will be kept confidential by the agency."
 FH ,National Archives of Australia, Anonymous ,13 April 2015, MR11/00388 ,http://www5.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/AICmr/2015/27.html,affirm,FOI," I affirm the decision of the National Archives of Australia (the Archives) of 17 October 2011 to refuse access to documents requested under the Freedom of Information Act 1982 (the FOI Act). This decision is given on the same day as another IC decision that deals with the same issue - FG and National Archives of Australia [2015] AICmr 26 (FG' and NAA). Both cases deal with applications under the FOI Act for access to information that could identify a person who obtained the FOI applicants Commonwealth record under the Archives Act 1983 (the Archives Act). In both instances, the record was more than 30 years old and had been placed in the open access period for the purposes of the Archives Act.  In FG' and NAA, I decided that an explanation given by an FOI applicant as to why they have sought access to third party personal information is a relevant matter in deciding whether disclosure would be unreasonable (s 47F) or contrary to the public interest (s 11A(5)). However, I went on to affirm the Archives decision in that case to refuse access, by concluding that it would generally be unreasonable and contrary to the public interest to disclose personal identifying information of a person who has accessed a government service that is made freely available to members of the public on the basis and in the expectation that a persons use of the service will be kept confidential by the agency. I have reached the same decision in this case. However, I draw attention below to a distinguishing feature of this case that the information about the FOI applicant has been published on a public website that is hosted by persons who are apparently unknown and in a manner that is humiliating to the applicant. I comment below on whether a special case may be made in those circumstances for not refusing access under the FOI Act to information that identifies a person who accessed that information under the public access statute."

In substitution, I decide that a practical refusal reason does not exist.[1] PM&C must now process the applicants request, and notify the applicant of its decision no later than 30 days after it receives this decision."
 Linton Besser ,Department of Employment, 28 employment service providers ,15 October 2015," MR12/00203, MR12/00204 and MR12/00419 ",http://www5.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/AICmr/2015/67.html,set aside,FOI," Under s 55K of the Freedom of Information Act 1982 (the FOI Act), I set aside the decisions of the Department of Employment[1] (the Department) of 13 April 2012, 18 April 2012 and 19 November 2012. I substitute my decision that: the documents the Department found to be exempt under s 37(1)(a) of the FOI Act are not exempt under this provision; the material the Department contends is exempt under s 37(2)(b) and s 42 of the FOI Act is now irrelevant to the request; the material the Department contends is exempt under s 47D of the FOI Act is not exempt under this provision; document 3 of MR12/00203 is not exempt under s 47C of the FOI Act; it would not be contrary to the public interest, to give access to the material in documents 36, 41, 42 and 43 of MR12/00203 that the Department found to be conditionally exempt under s 47C of the FOI Act; in relation to the PRAs, all material except for the names of the service providers is irrelevant to the request, and the names of the service providers are not exempt; material that has a competitive value, such as the information under the subject headings Environmental Factors, Site Specific and Area Strength is irrelevant to the request; the material the Department contends is exempt under s 47G of the FOI Act is not exempt under this provision; and to the extent that a document directly identifies an individual, or would or could indirectly identify a complainant or a witness, the identifying material is now irrelevant to the request. This decision rejects the contention that publicly releasing documents identifying organisations investigated by the Department in response to allegations of fraud would unreasonably affect those organisations. The contention rested principally on s 47G (business affairs) public interest conditional exemption. This decision recognises the role of the public interest in the test of unreasonableness for the purposes of s 47G and separately, the role of the public interest in giving access to conditionally exempt documents under s 11A(5). The Department should now prepare an edited copy of the documents under s 22 of the FOI Act, modified by deletions to remove exempt and irrelevant material and give Mr Besser access to the edited copy. The deletion of personal information should extend to ensuring that individuals generally are not directly identified; and that witnesses and complainants specifically are not directly or indirectly identified. The deletions should not otherwise extend to the business affairs (s 47G) material that I have found is not exempt."

I substitute my decision that: documents 1, 4, 8, 9, 16, 18, 20, 21, 23, 24 and 25 are now outside the scope of the request and are therefore irrelevant to the request; and documents 5, 6, 7, 10, 11, 12, 13 and 14 are exempt in full under s 45 of the FOI Act. I affirm the Treasurys decision as it relates to documents 2, 3, 15, 17, 19 and 22."

I substitute my decision that: a practical refusal reason does not exist in relation to Parts 1, 2, 5 and 6 of the request; and the Department must continue to process all seventeen parts of the request. I have come to this decision on the basis that the Department has not discharged its onus under s 55D of the FOI Act of establishing that its decision is justified, or that I should give a decision adverse to the IC review applicant. The Department must now process Ms Maria Jockels request, and notify her of its decision no later than 30 days after it receives this decision.[1] This decision emphasises the duty that agencies have to take reasonable steps to assist a person to make an FOI request under s 15(3) of the FOI Act; and to assist a person to revise an FOI request so that a practical refusal reason no longer exists under s 24AB(3) of the FOI Act."

I substitute my decision to decide that: the part of document 5 that the AFP found to be exempt is conditionally exempt under s 47B of the FOI Act and giving the applicant access to this material would be contrary to the public interest the part of document 1 that the AFP found to be exempt under s 47E(d) is conditionally exempt under s 47E(c) and giving the applicant access to this material would be contrary to the public interest the parts of documents 2, 4, 5, 7, 8 and 9 that the AFP found to be exempt are conditionally exempt under s 47E(c) and giving the applicant access to this material would be contrary to the public interest the parts of documents 5, 6 and 7 comprising the names and initials of AFP officers that the AFP found to be exempt under s 47F are not conditionally exempt, and the remaining parts of documents 1-9 that the AFP found to be exempt are conditionally exempt under s 47F and giving the applicant access to this material would be contrary to the public interest.
