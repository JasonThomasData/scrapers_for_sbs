Veda also provided the complainants credit report, which contained misleading information, to other entities in breach of s 18R(1) of the Privacy Act.

In relation to Vedas practice of recording similar enquiry listings, I recommend that Veda: develop revised training packages and user information guides for subscribers, which clearly address the issue of similar enquiry listings and how to interpret them engage an independent auditor to assess Vedas cross-referencing processes, both the multiple identity report (MIR) option and the non- MIR alternative, in compliance with s 18G(a) of the Privacy Act.
