Anne Davies|"Department of the Prime Minister and CabinetPrime Minister of
Australia"| |22 February 2013|MR11/00046, MR11/00072|http://www5.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/AICmr/2013/10.html|affirm|FOI Act| This statement of reasons concerns two applications from the same applicant for Information Commissioner review (IC review) under the Freedom of Information Act 1982 (the FOI Act). Both IC review applications raise a similar issue as to whether a practical refusal reason exists under s 24AA(1) of the FOI Act for refusing the applicants requests for access to diary entries of the current and a former Prime Minister. The two decisions under review are:  a decision of the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet (the Department) of 11 February 2011, refusing access to three months of diary entries of former Prime Minister, the Honourable Kevin Rudd MP; and a decision of the Office of the Prime Minister of 25 March 2011, refusing access to one month of diary entries of the current Prime Minister, the Honourable Julia Gillard MP. I affirm both decisions to refuse access to documents under s 24(1) of the FOI Act. I am satisfied that a practical refusal reason exists in each case. Specifically, I am satisfied that the work involved in processing each request would, in relation to the diary entries of former Prime Minister Rudd, substantially and unreasonably divert the resources of the Department from its other operations; and in relation to the diary entries of Prime Minister Gillard, substantially and unreasonably interfere with the Prime Ministers functions.

The Office of the Prime Minister must now make a decision on the applicants FOI request, considering whether any exemptions apply to the documents requested.

The result of this decision is that the Department is required by s 55N of the FOI Act to provide to the FOI applicant (Mr Hedley Thomas) certain documents that are described below. However, the Department cannot take that step until the opportunities available to the person who initiated this IC review (referred to as AK) to apply to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal for review of this IC review decision have run out (FOI Act, ss 4(1), 27A(6)). In order to preserve the effectiveness of that right of review, these reasons do not contain information that directly identifies AK or that reveal the substance of the documents that are in contention. I am, however, aware that the identity of AK is known to the FOI applicant and formed the basis of the request that he made to the Department under s 15 of the FOI Act for access to documents.

David Crowe|Department of the Treasury| |29 August 2013|MR11/00007|http://www5.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/AICmr/2013/69.html|affirm|FOI Act| I affirm the decision of Department of the Treasury (Treasury) of 25 March 2011 to refuse access to pages of the Treasury blue book prepared for the 2010 election, under s 47C of the Freedom of Information Act 1982 (Cth) (FOI Act). These reasons for decision also discuss more generally   whether an incoming government brief prepared for a party that did not form government may, in its entirety, be a conditionally exempt document under s 47E of the FOI Act, and whether an incoming government brief prepared for a party that did form government may, as to the deliberative matter in the document, be a conditionally exempt document under s 47C of the FOI Act. No concluded view is expressed on either issue. Neither issue squarely arises for decision in this case. Both ss 47C and 47E are also public interest conditional exemptions, which means that the exempt status of a document can be determined authoritatively only at the time a decision is to be made. A conditionally exempt document must be released unless disclosure, at the time of decision, would on balance be contrary to the public interest (FOI Act s 11A(5)). These reasons discuss public interest factors that may be considered when such an issue arises for decision.
